## QB SETUP

First off all make sure to import the `kq_extra table.sql` into
your database.

Once that's done. Add the `kq_outfitbag` item to your denalifw-core

Open the `config.lua` file and set qb enabled to true



___
Optionally you can also enable `denalifw-target` or `qtarget` if you're using either
